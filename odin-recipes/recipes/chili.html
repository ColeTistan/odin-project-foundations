            Using beer in chili adds incredible flavor to an underrated
            summer menu item. Bring a big ol' thermos of this to a picnic or
            other warm-weather cookout, and it will make a great side to those
            grilled burgers and dogs. Just have some insulated cups around — 
            and maybe some hot sauce — and you'll be in business. But no 
            matter what season it is, I hope you give this beef, bean, and beer chili a try soon.

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol class="steps">
            <li>
                Place a large pot over high heat; drizzle in oil. 
                Cook and stir ground beef, onion, and salt in hot 
                oil until beef is crumbly and browned and any 
                released liquid evaporates, about 4 minutes. 
                Reduce heat to medium-high. 
                Add chile powder, garlic, cumin, paprika, black pepper, and cinnamon. 
                Cook and stir until mixture begins to darken, 3 to 4 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour in beer. Add water, tomato purée, cocoa powder, oregano, and cayenne; 
                stir well. Bring to a simmer; reduce heat to medium-low and cook for 30 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir in beans and poblano pepper. Simmer until peppers are tender 
                and flavors have blended, about 30 minutes; 
                add more water if chili becomes too thick.
            </li>
        </ol>
