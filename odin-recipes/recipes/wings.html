            Homemade Buffalo Wings have a secret ingredient that makes them 
            super crisp and irresistible. The easy buffalo sauce is just 3 
            ingredients and makes these taste like a restaurant-quality appetizer.
        <br/>
            If you loved our Air Fryer Chicken Wings, you'll love these Oven-Baked 
            Buffalo Chicken Wings. You can bake a bigger batch all at once which 
            is great for feeding a crowd. Think Super Bowl appetizer.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul class="ingredients">
            <li>
                Chicken wings - Use fresh or thawed frozen wings that are broken down into drumettes and wingettes
            </li>
            <li>
                Baking powder - The secret ingredient for getting your chicken wings ultra-crispy without the need for deep frying
            </li>
            <li>
                Salt - we use fine sea salt in nearly all of our cooking       
            </li>
            <li>
                Garlic powder - adds a bit of zest to your wings before tossing them in the buffalo sauce
            </li>
            <li>
                Unsalted butter - adds a nice creaminess to the buffalo sauce
            </li>
            <li>
                Frank's Original Red Hot Sauce - This is the perfect base for your wing sauce. 
                It's tangy, a little sweet, and has just the right amount of spiciness.
            </li>
            <li>
                Sugar - helps the sauce caramelize and thicken on your piping hot wings.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol class="steps">
            <li>
                Prep Chicken Wings - cut wings in half to separate the drums from the wingettes.
                Pat the wings dry with a paper towel. Preheat the oven and line a rimmed baking
                sheet with foil and place a wire rack over the pan.
            </li>
            <li>
                Make dry seasoning - Combine baking powder, salt, and garlic powder.
            </li>
            <li>
                Season the wings - Place the chicken wings in a large mixing bowl and toss them 
                in the dry seasoning until well-coated. Assemble the wings in a single layer over the rack.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in the center of the oven for 50 minutes, flipping halfway.
            </li>
            <li>
                Make the Buffalo Sauce - In a medium bowl, stir together melted butter, sugar, and hot sauce.
            </li>
            <li>
                Toss Wings in Sauce - Transfer chicken wings to a bowl, and toss, 
                drizzle with sauce and toss to coat. Serve with your favorite sauce.
